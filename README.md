# Decentralized Healthcare Application

## Overview
The **Decentralized Healthcare Application** is designed to provide secure, patient-controlled health records using blockchain technology. By leveraging Polygon and zk-SNARKs, the system ensures secure data sharing and interoperability while maintaining compliance with privacy regulations.

## Problem Statement
In medical emergencies, fragmented health records delay care by up to 30 minutes due to siloed EHRs and paper-based systems. Traditional centralized EHR systems are prone to breaches, with over **15 million U.S. health records exposed in 2023**. Existing standards like FHIR and HL7 lack seamless interoperability, and blockchain solutions struggle with GDPR compliance.

### **Solution**
The **Decentralized PHR System** empowers patients by:
- **Providing Ownership**: Patients have full control over their health data.
- **Ensuring Security**: Data is securely stored and shared using zk-SNARKs.
- **Enabling Interoperability**: AI-driven conversion of legacy records to FHIR format.
- **Rapid Emergency Access**: Quick data retrieval in under 60 seconds via NFC-enabled mobile applications.

## Tech Stack
- **Blockchain**: Polygon
- **Privacy-Preserving Tech**: zk-SNARKs
- **AI Integration**: FHIR record conversion
- **Mobile Access**: NFC-enabled sharing

## System Workflow
1. **Patient Data Ownership**: Users control their records, stored securely on the blockchain.
2. **Data Encryption & Sharing**: Health data is encrypted and shared with authorized parties using zk-SNARKs.
3. **Interoperability Support**: AI-powered conversion ensures compatibility with existing health record systems.
4. **Emergency Access**: Healthcare providers can retrieve patient records quickly in urgent situations.

## Design & UI
- Intuitive mobile app for patient and doctor access
- Secure authorization and access management
- NFC-enabled emergency data retrieval

## Implementation
- **Backend**: Smart contracts on Polygon
- **Frontend**: Mobile and web applications for patient and provider access
- **Interoperability**: AI-driven conversion to FHIR format
